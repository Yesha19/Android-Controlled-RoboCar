# Android Controlled Robo-Car
The system will work on the control commands sent by the app. The commands could either be in the form of touch on the app screen or by the speech. These commands will be received by the Bluetooth module attached to the robot. The received data would then be passed on to Arduino which will further send instructions to the motor driver. The motor driver will amplify the low-current control signal to high-current control signal for the purpose of driving the motors. Ultimately, the motors will make the robot move in desired directions. In return, the robot also sends back information regarding the distance from the closest obstacle to the phone and if it reaches very close to a certain obstacle it will automatically stop.
